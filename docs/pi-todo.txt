STUFF THAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN STUFF GETS MOVED AROUND:

BANK 00:

Easy testing: Move 00:3A62-3A74 to 00:0073, just after the NMI handler.
Currently using src/diet.asm as a testbed for more extreme testing of PI.

- When getting hit and losing rings, the ring sprite turns to garbage.

BANK 01:

- When Sonic is damaged and loses his rings, the ring sprite doesn't seem to show.
- GHZ3 boss fight still breaks quite horribly.

BANK 02:

- Some Bank 01 code calls into Bank 02 but uses an absolute pointer. This is due to the disassembler being very conservative about where it can and can't jump. I need to make this work safely.
