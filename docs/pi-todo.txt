STUFF THAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN STUFF GETS MOVED AROUND:

BANK 00:

Easy testing: Move 00:3A62-3A74 to 00:0073, just after the NMI handler.
Currently using src/diet.asm as a testbed for more extreme testing of PI.

- When getting hit and losing rings, the ring sprite turns to garbage.
- One of Robotnik's running sprites at the end of SKY3 are invisible.

BANK 01:

- When Sonic is damaged and loses his rings, the ring sprite doesn't seem to show.
- GHZ3 boss fight still breaks quite horribly.
- BRI3 boss fight fireballs have glitched graphics.
- The bottom of the animal capsule does not appear... and the capsule completely disappears when it opens. (seen in BRI3, JUN3)
- In LAB3, a weird dark-blue box shows on the right side of where Robotnik shows up at the bottom.
- The transporter to go from the bottom to the top of the room in SCR2 doesn't work, nor does the SKY3 one at the end.

BANK 02:

- Some Bank 01 code calls into Bank 02 but uses an absolute pointer. This is due to the disassembler being very conservative about where it can and can't jump. I need to make this work safely.
