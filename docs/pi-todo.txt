STUFF THAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN STUFF GETS MOVED AROUND:

BANK 00:

Easy testing: Move 00:3A62-3A74 to 00:0073, just after the NMI handler.
Currently using src/diet.asm as a testbed for more extreme testing of PI.

- When getting hit and losing rings, the ring sprite turns to garbage.

BANK 01:

- Screen doesn't unblank at e.g. GHZ1, all you have is music.

BANK 02:

- 02:8003 needs to be disassembled so it can be pointed to.
