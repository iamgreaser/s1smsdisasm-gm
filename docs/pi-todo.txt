STUFF THAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN STUFF GETS MOVED AROUND:

BANK 00:

Easy testing: Move 00:3A62-3A74 to 00:0073, just after the NMI handler.
Currently using src/diet.asm as a testbed for more extreme testing of PI.

- When getting hit and losing rings, the ring sprite turns to garbage.

BANK 01:

- Motobugs don't move, and their graphics can glitch out.
- Crabmeats and Buzz Bombers have glitched graphics and fire early and rapidly, making them an actual threat.
- When Sonic is damaged and loses his rings, the ring sprite doesn't seem to show.
- GHZ3 boss fight, when spawned, seems to break Sonic (making him invisible and inoperable?) and the boss doesn't spawn properly. Pausing still works somehow?

BANK 02:

None known right now.
