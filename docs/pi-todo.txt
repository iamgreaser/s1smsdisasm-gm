STUFF THAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN STUFF GETS MOVED AROUND:

BANK 00:

Easy testing: Move 00:3A62-3A74 to 00:0073, just after the NMI handler.
Currently using src/diet.asm as a testbed for more extreme testing of PI.

No known PI problems on this bank!

BANK 01:

- The bottom of the animal capsule does not appear... and the capsule completely disappears when it opens. (seen in BRI3, JUN3)
- In LAB3, a weird dark-blue box shows on the right side of where Robotnik shows up at the bottom.

BANK 02:

No known PI problems on this bank!
