STUFF THAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN STUFF GETS MOVED AROUND:

BANK 00:

Easy testing: Move 00:3A62-3A74 to 00:0073, just after the NMI handler.
Currently using src/diet.asm as a testbed for more extreme testing of PI.

No known PI problems! Yay!

BANK 01:

- Various objfuncs store a pointer byte by byte in (IX+$0F) denoted as (ix+15) in the disassembly.
   - Screen doesn't unblank at e.g. GHZ1, all you have is music.

BANK 02:

- 02:8003 needs to be disassembled so it can be pointed to.
- Various objfuncs store a pointer byte by byte in (IX+$0F) denoted as (ix+15) in the disassembly.
   - Final cutscene (level $12), Robotnik's graphics are borked.
